Defect and QA

Defect: error/fault/failure

Defect prevention/removal/containment

Map to major QA activities

Defect prevention

Error source removal & error blocking
Defect removal: Inspection/testing/etc

Defect containment: Fault tolerance and failure containment (safety assurance)

Comparison: This chapter

Comparison
Cost-benefit under given environments

Environments: applicable or not?

Cost to perform

Benefit: quality, directly or indirectly

Testing as the comparison baseline

Most commonly performed QA activity

Empirical and internal data for testing

QA alternatives compared to testing

defect prevention (DP),

inspection,

formal verification (FV),

fault tolerance (FT),

failure containment (FC)

FT & FC: separate items in comparison

Comparison: Applicability
Applicability questions

High-level questions:

development vs. field usage (and support/maintenance)

Low level questions:

development phases/activities

Applicability to maintenance

Not applicable: Defect prevention

(although lessons applied to future)

Applicable to a limited degree:

Inspection, testing, formal verification, as related to reported field failures

Applicable:

fault tolerance and failure containment, but designed/implemented during development

Our focus:

applicability to development

Objects QA activities applied on

Mostly on specific objects

e.g., testing executable code
Exception: defect prevention on

(implementation related) dev. activities
